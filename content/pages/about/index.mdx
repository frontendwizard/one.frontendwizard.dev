Hi! I am Juliano.

I'm a front end engineer and I help companies build applications on the web, be it on mobile or desktop, with React.js. As an engineer I'll be on the watch for the application architecture, scalability and complexity. I strive for keeping things as simple as possible and iterating over it.

I'm more than happy to talk about engineering or any programming related topics, but not only. If you feel like talking to me, be it business or some career advices or just some good old chat, don't hesitate to reach me on twitter or shoot me an email.
